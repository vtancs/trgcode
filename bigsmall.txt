All Possible Rolls: Using itertools.product, we generate all possible outcomes of rolling three dice.

    Probability Calculation: For each roll:
        Sum Probabilities: We count how many times each sum (from 3 to 18) appears.
        Specific Triple Probabilities: We count how many times each specific triple (e.g., 111, 222) appears.
        Any Triple Probability: We count how many times any triple appears.
        Double Probabilities: We count how many times at least two of the dice show a specific number.
        Single Probabilities: We count how many times each number appears on one or more dice.
    Convert Counts to Probabilities: We convert the counts into probabilities by dividing by the total number of outcomes (216).
    Display Results: We print out the probabilities for each type of bet.

This program calculates and displays the probabilities for different types of bets in Sic Bo, providing an accurate overview of the game's odds.

To calculate the probability of consecutive "Big" and "Small" outcomes occurring in Sic Bo, we need to first define what "Big" and "Small" mean:

    "Big" refers to the sum of the three dice being between 11 and 17 (inclusive), except when all three dice show the same number (a triple).
    "Small" refers to the sum of the three dice being between 4 and 10 (inclusive), except when all three dice show the same number (a triple).

Let's break down the steps to calculate the probabilities:

    Calculate the probability of getting a "Big" result.
    Calculate the probability of getting a "Small" result.
    Simulate a series of Sic Bo rolls and count the occurrences of consecutive "Big" and "Small" results.

First, let's calculate the probabilities for "Big" and "Small" outcomes
